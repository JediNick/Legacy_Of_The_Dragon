### Several new mechanics

- Prophecy Reading - Owners of Aegon's dagger will be able to rediscover 'The Song Of Ice and Fire' prophecy. Be warned, prophecies are dangerous things.

- Valyrian Face Mask decision - Tired of wearing a giant mask every time you gain the disfigured trait? Fear no more! Westerosi leaders with a bit of gold can buy a new show inspired facemask to get rid of the vanilla one.

- Rediscover Mechanic - The rediscover mechanic is an optional mechanic that allows Targaryen rulers to send their antiquarian off in search of long lost Targaryen artifacts.
By default, Aerys Targaryen will no longer spawn with all Targaryen crowns and items, these will instead need to be recovered using the new mechanic.

- Aegon I's Crown Rubies - Owners of Aegon I's crown can sell the rubies on the crown in a pinch for some extra gold, in a similar fashion the rubies can be repurchased with enough gold.

### Optional Flavor
Houses Celtigar, Velaryon, and Qoherys have alternate visuals for their Valyrian Steel weapons. This can be enabled through the 'Optional Flavor' game rule.

- Seafoam - The ancestral Valyrian Steel saber of House Velaryon.

- Calamity - A deadly Valyrian Steel axe passed down through the lords of House Celtigar.

- Subterfuge - An insidious dagger owned by House Qoherys, it is said to have involved in the rise and fall of many rulers of Old Valyria. This dagger can only be obtained by reviving House Qoherys via the House Customizer in vanilla AGOT.


The mod also features a dozen new coat of arms that can be used in the coat of arms designer. These new coat of arms are all based on the actual Valyrian Glyph system devised by David J. Peterson/dedalvs.

### Highly customizable

Most of the mod features can be toggled allowing you to control your experience and feature sets.

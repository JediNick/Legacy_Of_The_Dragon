 rediscover_events_0001_desc:0 "A number of my ancestors artifacts remain lost to this day, some of which date back to before [aegonTarg.GetTitledFirstName] arrived in Westeros...\n\nPerhaps with enough gold and the right mind they could be returned to House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName]..."

 rediscover_events_0002_desc:0 ""I will return soon my [main.GetTitleTierName]!"\n\nAnd with that, [antiquarian.GetFirstName] is gone, in search of artifacts long lost..."


 rediscover_events_1001_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName], weather-beaten and worn, carries in a burden wrapped in cloth to my throneroom.\n\n[antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] kneels and unveiles the legendary Blackfyre, one of two ancestral swords of House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName], its hilt gleaming with the reflections of distant history and untold perils.\n\nAt last, the long-lost symbol of House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] has been returned to its rightful place."

 rediscover_events_1002_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] returns atlast to my court. I immediately notice [antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] has been through the seven hells...\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]," [antiquarian.GetFirstName] bows deeply, "I bring news and a gift from beyond The Wall."\n\n[antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] presents me a blade once wielded by my ancestors. Dark Sister, one of two Vayrian Steel blades owned by House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName]...\n\nIt was rumoured that [brynden.GetFirstNameNicknamed] had brought the sword with him to the Nights Watch...it has remained lost beyond the Wall until now."

 rediscover_events_1003_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives, and with [antiquarian.GetHerHim] is an artifact surrounded with great mystery and intrigue...\n\n"A dagger my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], made of Valyrian Steel..."\n\n[antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] presents it to me.\n\n[antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] continues, "I've found scarce readings from old letters and books that mention a dagger that once was owned by [aenar.GetTitledFirstName], and eventually [aegonTarg.GetTitledFirstName]...It appears very few times in the writings up until its recorded ownership by [viserys.GetTitledFirstName]...it all but disappeared from the writings after The Dance."\n\nIntriguing, a third Valyrian Steel weapon that belonged to my ancestors? Strange...\n\nI wonder what mystery lies in this dagger..."

 rediscover_events_1004_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives to my courtroom and presents a mighty weapon to me.\n\n"The war hammer of [orys.GetTitledFirstName]...This hammer was wielded by [orys.GetFirstName] following the Conquest...It's rumored that [orys.GetFirstNamePossessive] half brother, [aegonTarg.GetTitledFirstName], gifted it after his conquest."\n\nIt had been passed down through the Lords of House [orys.GetDynasty.GetBaseName], but its roots go back to House [aegonTarg.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] as [orys.GetFirstName] was originally a [aegonTarg.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] bastard!\n\nWhile the hammer now belongs to me, I have no doubt that [baratheon_head.GetTitledFirstName] yearns for this weapon...\n\nPerhaps returning it to House [orys.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] would be a gesture of good will? \n\nOr maybe it is better kept in the hands of House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName]..."

 rediscover_events_1005_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives to my courtroom and presents a mighty gift for me.\n\n"The crown of The Conqueror...May the strength of [aegonTarg.GetTitledFirstName] be reborn in you..."\n\n[aegonTarg.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned with this circlet by his sister wife, [visenya.GetFirstName], following his arrival in Westeros.\n\nIt had been passed down from [aegonTarg.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] King to [aegonTarg.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] King until it was lost in Dorne along with [daeron.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nNow it has returned to House [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName], albeit with the rubies plucked from their sockets...\n\nPerhaps I could pay an artisan to have the crown restored to its former glory?"

 rediscover_events_1006_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives to my courtroom and presents a royal gift to me.\n\n"The crown of [aenys.GetTitledFirstName]...It was lost sometime after the death of [jaehaerys.GetTitledFirstName], but alas now it is found..."\n\nThis crown was was worn by the second [main.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] King in Westeros, [aenys.GetTitledFirstName] before his death at the hands of [maegor.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nIt has now returned to its rightful owners."

 rediscover_events_1007_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives at last.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]!

It's fate has long been unknown following the Dance of Dragons when [rhae.GetTitledFirstName] sold it to Braavosi merchants.\n\nNow it has been returned to its rightful owners."

 rediscover_events_1008_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives, and with [antiquarian.GetHerHim] carries a rather small item.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]!

 rediscover_events_1009_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] arrives at last, and with [antiquarian.GetHerHim] carries an artifact from my ancestors...\n\n"The crown of [aegon_3.GetTitledFirstName]...A simpler artifact of your house, but one that still carries significant meaning." [antiquarian.GetFirstName] says.\n\nThe crown of the Dragonbane marks the transition of House [aegonTarg.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] from dragonlords, to mere mortals, their once-mighty dragons reduced to mere echoes of a bygone era."

 rediscover_events_1012_desc:0 "[antiquarian.GetFirstName] returns, and with [antiquarian.GetHerHim] is a rather interesting item...\n\n[antiquarian.GetSheHe|U] presents a crown made of flowers to me.\n\n"The mask of the [baelor.GetTitledFirstName] 'the Blessed'.\n\nIt is remarkable how this artifact has survived the years..."

My blood begins to boil and my vision fades into nothing but a blur of light. My skin feels like it is burning. All I can see and hear is the prohecy..."From my blood will come the prince that was promised...From my blood will come the prince that was promised" "

My vision fades as they strangle me...\n\nI once again find myself in my chambers...safe albeit a bit jarred."
